403 in media res for Joseph of Arimathea

* Designates the start of a passus according to the editions, but that is not distinguished in the manuscript itself. 

_____

Skeat: 

Its date is about 1370-80. This MS. Is indeed a noble and an admirable one. Its immense size, and the beauty of the vellum, of the writing, and of the illuminated letters have long since attracted notice, and it has already been made considerable use of by editors, and several extracts from it are in print.  It would be a good deed to print it all, and it will receive considerable attention from our Society.  It has received the name of “Sowle-hele,” as containing things useful for the soul’s health; and the name is a good one: the poems and treatises in it, which are very numerous, being chiefly of a religious cast.  On a square slip, pasted inside the cover, are the words, somewhat defaced, “Bibliothecae Bodleianae Dono dedit Edvardus Vernon Armiger olim ex col. Trin. In bac universitate Superioris ordinis Commensalis in nupero bello civili a partibus regijs strenue prpugnabat Militum trbu[nus].” It contains considerably more than 400 large leaves, each containing two columns, and each column, when written without breaks, contains about 80 lines. The “Piers Plowman” occupies but a small space in it, beginning at fol. 394b, col. 2, and ending with fol. 401 b, taking up just 28 columns and a half.  The initial letters, denoted in this volume by large capitals, are illuminated in gold and colors.  The Passus are not numbered, but are denoted by leaving a blank line above them, and these divisions exactly agree with those of the other MSS. of the same type.  The poem is written in long lines, as here printed, and each line is divided into two by a metrical dot, here denoted by an inverted full stop, indicated a pause of the voice, such as is often equivalent to a comma in punctuation, but which must sometimes be disregarded as a punctuating mark, just as we sometimes so disregard a colon in the Prayer-book version of the Psalms… [does not follow MS punctuation, explains]
In other respects, it has been very faithfully followed, its capital letters preserved and all expansions of contractions marked by the use of italics.  The paragraph marks are, in the MS., painted red and blue alternately.  Among the illuminated letters we often meet with the thorn-letter, but never a capital [yogh].  This is owing to the illuminator, who has made a capital Y more than once where a small 3 can be detected as having been written to tell him what to do.  

This MS. was taken for the text, not solely because it is the oldest and best written, but also because a careful collation of it with the rest has shewn that its readings are, on the whole, better than that of any other…

[Some lines skipped by apparent scribal error—since they affect the sense—are supplied by other MSS] Only one or two bad ones have been relegated to the foot-notes.  

The MS. has but one great defect.  It is, that a single leaf has been cut out of it with a sharp knife, the extreme inner edge of the leaf being still visible.  Most unfortunately, this leaf is the very one which contains the concluding portion of the last Passus; so that we cannot certainly say how it ended.  At the same time, it is very evident that it never contained much beyond these eleven Passus, for a leaf can only contain 320 lines at most, and there are about 140 lines lost from the eleventh Passus, which would nearly fill up the one side of the leaf.  But the poem which follows “Piers Plowman” has lost its beginning so that the contents of this leaf can be nearly accounted for.  The abundance of my materials has enabled me to remedy this defect in a great measure, by giving the missing portion of the poem from MS. T, with collations from four others.

Kane: 

Vellum, 341 leaves, size 21 1/2 to 22 x 15 to 15 1/2 inches; folios numbered in roman, top left verso, with various errors; a subsidiary arabic numbering, top right recto, begins after cccx. Contains Piers Plowman A Prologue-XI 183 on fols. cccxciiij-cccxcxj, with 160 lines per page in two columns. 
CONDITION
What survives of this manuscript is well preserved, but it appears to lack 73 leaves, lost either as whole quires when unbound, or subsequently when illuminated pages were cut out.  Piers Plowman is physically intact except for the loss of its last leaf (fol. 402). This could have held 320 lines, that is the 135-40 lines needed to finish Passus XI and at least 180 more. It could thus have accommodated the 117 lines of Passus XII as well as a beginning for the next item, Joseph of Arimathea. But since the Vernon text of the alliterative life of Joseph appears to be unique there is no way of determining how much of fol. 402 was originally occupied by Piers Plowman. 
DIVISIONS OF TEXT
A space of one line is left at the beginning of each section of the poem presumably for the later insertion of a rubric, except at the beginning of Passus IX where, in the hand and ink of the text, is the legend Incipit hic. Dowel. Dobet. and Dobest.
HANDWRITING
An expert English vernacular hand. The letters þ and y, and u and n are carefully distinguished.
DATE
The manuscript is dated ‘about 1370-80’ by Skeat (A-Text, p. Xv), and 1380-1400 by others (Serjeantson, p. 222). But the scope of the collection, the character of its Piers Plowman text, presupposing a considerable number of stages of transmission, and the lateness of Harley 875, the genetic twin of the Vernon Piers Plowman text, argue that the Vernon manuscript was copied nearer 1400 than 1380. 
HISTORY
Dialect study of the index to the manuscript associates this with Staffordshire. Recent investigations connect Colonel Edward Vernon, who presented the manuscript to the Bodleian Library in 1677, with Houndhill, Staffs.
